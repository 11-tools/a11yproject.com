Do you enjoy web accessibility and want to help? **Here's how you can help.**

## Writing articles
We have a list of articles we'd love to see written. Have an idea for an article? We'd love to know what you want to contribute.

1. Search to make sure someone hasn't snagged the article already.
2. Claim an article by starting a new issue with the article title and assign the issue to yourself. The final title can (or probably should) be different.
3. When you check-in, reference that issue number in the commit, i.e, `re: #32`

## Reporting issues
Notice something innaccurate? Noticed something inaccessible on this site? You think you can code something up better?

- File an issue.
- Tag your issue as either an `innaccuracy`, a `inaccessibility`, or a `bug` (for site issues).
- **ISSUES ARE NOT** free help on your website. Use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for that.

## Key branches

- `gh-pages` is the "master" branch. This is the website.

## Pull requests

- Filing a descriptive issue then assigning it to yourself before you commit would really help get your commit accepted.
- CSS changes must be done in .sass files first, never just the compiled files.

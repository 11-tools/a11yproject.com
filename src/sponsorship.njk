  How to sponsor
</h2>
<p>
  Thank you for considering us! Please email us at <a href=" mailto:a@b.com?subject=Sponsorship">hello@a11yproject.com</a> to get a conversation started. In addition, you can <a href="https://opencollective.com/the-a11y-project">make a donation via Open Collective</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="what-you-will-receive-for-sponsorship" class="c-heading-large">
  What you will receive for sponsorship
</h2>
<p>
  You will get a banner added to the <a href="#sponsors">sponsorship area</a> of each page of this website that can link to a website or web app of your choosing. In terms of exposure, The A11Y Project offers:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>~350,000 monthly views.</li>
  <li>Great search engine placement for terms related to digital accessibility.</li>
  <li>An association with a credible, long-running, and often cited resource.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-your-sponsorship-will-be-used-for" class="c-heading-large">
  What your sponsorship will be used for
</h2>
<p>
  The A11Y Project is run entirely by volunteer effort. Its <a href="/team/#maintainers">maintainers</a> do not pay themselves for the work they put into the website.
</p>
<p>
  Your sponsorship is primarily used to pay the <a href="/authors/">authors</a> who contribute posts. Creating solid, well-researched information about accessibility deserves to be rewarded.
</p>
<p>
  The remainder is used to pay the fees for services we use to keep this site running. These services include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A</li>
  <li>B</li>
  <li>Open Collective processing fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Sponsorship funds are stored in a dedicated bank account.

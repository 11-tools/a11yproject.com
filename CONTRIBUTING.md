# Contributing to Simple A11Y

Do you enjoy web accessibility and want to help? **Here's how you can help.**

## Writing articles
We have a list of articles we'd love to see written. Have an idea for an article? We'd love to know what you want to contribute.

1. Search to make sure someone hasn't snagged the article already.
2. Claim an article by starting a new issue with the article title and assign the issue to yourself. The final title can (or probably should) be different.
3. When you check&ndash;in, reference that issue number in the commit, i.e, `re: #32`
4. Articles can either be subitted via a pull request or written as a [gist](https://gist.github.com). Link us to your [gist](https://gist.github.com) in the [issue filed](https://github.com/davatron5000/simpleA11Y/issues) for your article and we'll be sure to clone and update our site accordingly with your masterpiece.

## Reporting issues
Notice something innaccurate? Noticed something inaccessible on this site? You think you can code something up better?

- File an issue.
- Tag your issue as either an `innaccuracy`, a `inaccessibility`, or a `bug` (for site issues).
- **ISSUES ARE NOT** free help on your website. Use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for that.

## Key branches

- `gh-pages` is the "master" branch. This is the website.

If you have a feature request(s) we suggest filing an issue initially to discuss your feature. Once that feature has been accepted you'll be off and running to feature making madness. Start a separate branch and use the following naming convention for your *feature branch*:

- `feature/name_of_feature` 

## Build Process
- In order to create a site build you'll need to make sure you've run through all the listed commands in the order they appear from our [README.md](https://github.com/davatron5000/simpleA11Y#local-development)
- CSS changes must be done in ``.sass`` files first, never just the compiled files. We use [Codekit](http://incident57.com/codekit) to compile our *Sass* and *Compass*.


## Pull requests

- Filing a descriptive issue then assigning it to yourself before you commit would really help get your commit accepted.

One quick way that you can check your site's accessibility is to attempt to navigate through the site using nothing but your keyboard.

1. Turn off your mouse.
2. Hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> to start browsing around your page.
3. Some menus or actions may require arrow keys.

This is by no means a complete accessibility check, but it can quickly help you find and define major accessibility problems.

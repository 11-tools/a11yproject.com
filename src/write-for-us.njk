<h2 id="what-kinds-of-writing-do-we-publish?">What kinds of writing do we publish?</h2>

<p>
  In addition to <a href="/events/">Events</a>, The A11Y Project features six main kinds of published content:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Posts</strong> are long form articles that discuss an aspect of accessibility in-depth. </li>
  <li><strong>Myths</strong> are short pieces that debunk common misconceptions and falsehoods about accessibility. </li>
  <li><strong>Quick tests</strong> outline a short collection of steps needed to check your content to determine if it is accessible.</li>
  <li><strong>Quick tips</strong> provide short, easy-to-digest and easy-to-implement accessibility-related information.</li>
  <li><strong>Assistive technology</strong> provides background information on the tools used by people who rely on them to navigate digital devices and interfaces.</li>
  <li><strong>How-tos</strong> are guides to implementing accessible code.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Additionally, we have <a rel="external noopener" href="https://github.com/a11yproject/a11yproject.com/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc">an Issue tracker</a> that lists different ongoing concerns and problems with the website.
</p>

<h2 id="our-audience">Our audience</h2>

<p>
  Our readers run the range from people who are completely new to the concept of accessibility to experienced practitioners who work full-time in the industry.
</p>

<p>
  Our content is written for people new to the industry. Because of this, we strive to keep our content short, easy to understand, and to the point. This serves everyoneâ€”sometimes people who have been doing accessibility work for a long time can benefit from a refresher!
</p>

</p>

<h2 id="what-we-wont-publish">What we won't publish</h2>

<p>
  As we are an open source project, we try to only promote content that is free, or has a low barrier to entry. We're not too keen on partnership deals, promotions, or referral schemes.
